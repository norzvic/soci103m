Welcome to the course website of SOCI 103M - Quantitative Research in Sociology with `R` at UC San Diego. This course is designed for undergraduate students who are interested in leveraging computational tools to manage and analyze quantitative data for answering questions relevant to sociology and social sciences more broadly.

In this course, the students are invited to work on a research project in groups. They are asked to go through a complete cycle of conducting social science research from scratch by proposing a research question, designing the research plan, collecting and analyzing the data, and presenting their findings to the class.

Please click the "Projects" button on the navigation bar to check out their projects.
